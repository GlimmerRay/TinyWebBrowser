<div>
    Some text goes here
    <p></p>
</div>


How do we handle whitespace inside brackets?

    <  div>
    <div >
    </p >
    < /p>
    < d iv>

We need an easier way to test

We need to test the case where a closing tag doesn't match its
corresponding opening tag.

We need to test the case where a closing tag never appears

We need to test the case where a right angled bracket never appears
after a left angled bracket

We need to test the case where extra white space exists between attributes
(should still work)

We need attributes to work with quotes as well as without quotes

We need to handle the case where there is extra text after
where the final tag should be. (Throw an error or just ignore it?)

Attributes take the form string1=string2 where string1 and string2 do
not contain whitespace.  If they do we'll throw an error.  Also, attributes
are delimited by whitespace.

What if the first non-whitespace character of the file is not a '>'?

What if the first tag is not named <html>?

What if the head or body tags are omitted?

What if one of the children of html is something other than body or head?

What if an attribute key is not in our list of valid keys?

Do we simply ignore anything that comes after the closing html tag?

We need unit tests for a the little functions

Need to handle non-closing tags.

What if white space precedes '/' for closing tag?
    -For now I'm just going to say that the inside of a tag must start
    with either '/' or a valid tag name character

What if a closing tag contains anything other than whitespace after its name?
(For example if attributes are defined in a closing tag).

What are the valid characters for a tag name?

What are the valid characters for an attribute name?

What are the valid characters for a value?

(CHECK) If I remove the opening <html> tag from test1.html
then my parser loops forever.  I need to fix that.
I'm pretty sure it's because of the whitespace.
