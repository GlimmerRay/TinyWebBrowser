<div>
    Some text goes here
    <p></p>
</div>


How do we handle whitespace inside brackets?

    <  div>
    <div >
    </p >
    < /p>
    < d iv>

If I remove the opening <html> tag from test1.html
then my parser loops forever.  I need to fix that.
I'm pretty sure it's because of the whitespace.

We need to handle attributes

We need an easier way to test

We need to test the case where a closing tag doesn't match its
corresponding opening tag.

We need to test the case where a closing tag never appears

We need to test the case where a right angled bracket never appears
after a left angled bracket

We need to test the case where extra white space exists between attributes
(should still work)

We need attributes to work with quotes as well as without quotes



We need to handle the case where there is extra text after
where the final tag should be. (Throw an error or just ignore it?)

Attributes take the form string1=string2 where string1 and string2 do
not contain whitespace.  If they do we'll throw an error.  Also, attributes
are delimited by whitespace.

We need unit tests for a the little functions
